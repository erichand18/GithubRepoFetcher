# GithubRepoFetcher
When given a github username, a list of that user's repositories is displayed.

## To run this project:
 - Run "npm install" to install all dev dependencies
 - Add your github API token in the config.example.js file (the API key only needs repo access)
 - Build the project using the react-dev npm script "npm run react-dev"
 - Start the server with "npm run start"
 - Play around in your browser by visiting port 1128 on your localhost: localhost:1128
 
## Future Plans:
 - Host this project on an EC2 instance to save a lot of trouble getting it running for other users
